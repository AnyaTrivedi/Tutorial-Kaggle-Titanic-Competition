# Kaggle Titanic Competition: Machine Learning from Disaster

Competiton Website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Kaggle's Titanic Competions's goal use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. This tutorial runs through the basic steps of a data science pipeline in the form of a jupyter notebook
- Exploring Data Patterns
- Data Pre-processing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Construction, Comparision and Selection
- Fine Tuning the Model 

Different classifiers are explored for this Binary Classification Task:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest 
- Decision Tree
- Perceptron
- K Nearest Neighbours Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
